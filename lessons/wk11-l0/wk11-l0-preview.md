# TLDR

This week covers a set of critical topics that every production-ready agentic AI system needs: monitoring, debugging, compliance, and deployment decisions.

# What‚Äôs in store this week?

This week, we cover a set of critical ‚Äî and distinct ‚Äî topics that don‚Äôt always get taught together, but every production-ready system depends on them.

We‚Äôll cover:

- **Lesson 1**: Learn what production-grade monitoring looks like for agentic systems ‚Äî what to trace, what to log, and how to track failures like hallucinations, bad routing, or tool misuse.
- **Lesson 2**: Get hands-on with debugging agents when they fail in unpredictable ways. You‚Äôll analyze traces, logs, and reruns to pinpoint root causes ‚Äî even when the bug only shows up sometimes.
- **Lesson 3**: Understand how to build with privacy and compliance in mind. We‚Äôll look at the implications of GDPR, HIPAA, and other frameworks when your agents handle real data.
- **Lesson 4**: Explore deployment strategies ‚Äî when to use hosted models versus API-based LLMs, and how to weigh tradeoffs like latency, control, compliance, reliability, and cost.
- **Lesson 5**: Walk through real-world development blueprints for agentic AI in enterprise contexts. These case studies connect the dots between architecture, compliance, monitoring, and maintenance.

By the end of this week, which also marks the final set of lessons in the program, you‚Äôll have a complete understanding of the essential skills needed to take an agentic AI system to production, and set it up for success beyond.

These are the skills that make the difference between a working prototype and a real-world AI system.

Let‚Äôs get started!
