# Ready Tensor Agentic AI Certification – Week 11

This repository contains lesson materials and code examples for **Week 11** of the [Agentic AI Developer Certification Program](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/HrJ0xWtLzLNt) by Ready Tensor.

This is a work-in-progress repository. We are actively adding code examples and documentationto this repository. Stay tuned for updates!

## What You'll Learn

- How to monitor agentic AI systems in production using logs, traces, and tools like **LangSmith**
- Techniques for debugging agent failures, hallucinations, and non-deterministic behavior
- Best practices for handling sensitive data and ensuring compliance with frameworks like **GDPR** and **HIPAA**
- Key considerations for choosing between **hosted models** and **API-based LLMs**, including tradeoffs in latency, control, cost, and reliability
- How to approach real-world agentic AI development through high-level case studies focused on system design, architecture, and planning decisions

## Lessons in This Repository

- **Lesson 1a: Monitoring and Observability 101**
  Understand the difference between monitoring and observation - and building blocks such as metrics, logs, and traces.

- **Lesson 1b: What to Monitor**
  Learn how to track failures like hallucinations, bad routing, and tool misuse. We’ll map common failure modes and their causes to the right metrics and traces.

- **Lesson 1c: Choosing Monitoring Tools**
  Compare popular observability tools for agentic systems, including LangSmith, Langfuse, OpenTelemetry, and others. You’ll learn what to look for and how to choose based on your stack and scale.

- **Lesson 1d: Diagnosing Root Causes**
  Go a level deeper to understand how to debug agentic AI systems when they misbehave.

* **Lesson 2**: Data Privacy and Compliance
  Learn how to design with privacy and compliance in mind. We’ll cover the implications of GDPR, HIPAA, and other frameworks when agents handle sensitive data.

* **Lesson 3**: Proprietary vs Open Weight LLMs
  Explore when to use proprietary APIs versus open-weight models, and how to weigh tradeoffs like performance, control, compliance, and cost.

- **Lesson 4**: Real-World Development Blueprints
  Walk through real-world agentic AI development blueprints, starting from project planning through development and deployment.
