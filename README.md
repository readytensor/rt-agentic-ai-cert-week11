## What You'll Learn

- How to monitor agentic AI systems in production using logs, traces, and tools like **LangSmith**
- Techniques for debugging agent failures, hallucinations, and non-deterministic behavior
- Best practices for handling sensitive data and ensuring compliance with frameworks like **GDPR** and **HIPAA**
- Key considerations for choosing between **hosted models** and **API-based LLMs**, including tradeoffs in latency, control, cost, and reliability
- How to approach real-world agentic AI development through high-level case studies focused on system design, architecture, and planning decisions

## Lessons in This Repository

### 1. Monitoring and Observability for Agentic AI

Learn how to track and interpret the right signals — from tool usage to bad routing to hallucinations — using logging, tracing, and visualization tools like LangSmith. Critical for keeping your agents healthy in production.

### 2. Troubleshooting Agent Failures and Non-Deterministic Behavior

Explore practical debugging strategies for agentic systems that fail in inconsistent or unpredictable ways. Use traces and logs to detect issues like refusal loops, unexpected outputs, and flaky behavior.

### 3. Data Privacy and Compliance for AI Systems

Understand how privacy laws like GDPR and HIPAA apply to AI systems. Learn best practices for handling sensitive data, obtaining consent, and architecting your agents to meet compliance requirements.

### 4. Deployment Choices: Hosted Models vs APIs

Weigh the tradeoffs between hosted models and API-based LLMs. This lesson helps you make informed deployment decisions based on control, latency, reliability, cost, and maintenance complexity.

### 5. Case Studies: Real-World Development Blueprints

Walk through high-level case studies that demonstrate how to approach the design and development of agentic AI systems from start to finish. Learn how to define scope, make key architectural decisions, plan for evaluation, and align your system with real-world needs — before writing a single line of code.
